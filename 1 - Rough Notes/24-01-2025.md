### About Counting the number of paths with sum S in a Tree.
- Keep  global hash_map to track the frequency of sums encountered.
- set current_sum = current_sum + node.val 
- As you reach a node, increase the frequency of **current_sum + node.val** by 1.
- set answer to 1 if current_sum equals S.
- increase answer by frequency of **current_sum - S**
	- as after these paths begin the subpaths with sum S till the current node.
- keep doing dfs to left and right
	- add the answers gotten from the above dfs to the current answer
- decrease the frequency of current_sum by 1
- return answer
