- The article mainly talks about the need for A2A protocol.
- It often draws comparison between A2A and MCP, calling out that the latter is mostly used for Model's interaction with tools/data.
- How A2A differs is that it allows multi-turn-interaction between varies domain specific agents.
- Other benefitis of A2A being :
	- It creates a standard interface of communication between agents which in turn
		- reduces integration costs, 
		- improves interoperability
		- robusts application of standard security practices.
	- It also allows Long running asynchronous execution of tasks
	
- Tools made as a wrapper over models restrict their capabilities to bring in some determinism in the behavior a tool is expected of. Hence this is not beneficial in A2A communication.

### Chapter/Section: 
* **Key Concept:** * **Say/Do:** (What it says vs. What it's doing)
	- multi-turn-interaction which is missing when agents interact with each other as tools wrapped with MCP. 
	- Long running async execution
