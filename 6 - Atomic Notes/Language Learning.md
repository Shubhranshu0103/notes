I think there 3 pillars for learning a language. The first being the conversation and the second being script/grammar and lastly the vocabulary.
### Audio based apps for conversation fluency
Choose audio based learning apps that maintstream visual apps. There are two apps, one free [Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/)and the other [Pimsleur](https://learn.pimsleur.com/Learn)

Then there is [Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com/pricing) which is an audial flash cards app.
[Preply](https://preply.com/) is for learning with a tutor

### Script/Grammar apps for building confidence in what and how one speaks and reads
Lingo deer is really good for this. 

### Apps for building vocabulary
[Beelingua](https://beelinguapp.com/) is an app which provides reading material. The way user reads the material is parallelly in his native and the target language.
