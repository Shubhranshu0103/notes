- [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP7ef4eVnac&list=WL) talks about how to author of sqlite end up making a selfcontained small database engine.
- It barely has any dependency allowing it to be run on various systems including embedded ones so much so that it is part of various airline buses..
- Interesting it has 40 year backward compatibility till 2050 because of an agreement done with Airbus.
- The authors also take up very specific feature requests and make them part of extensions which can then plugged in with the core as required.
	- In this way the core remains minimal, but new features can be catered took.
